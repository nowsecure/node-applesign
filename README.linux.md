# Running applesign on Linux

It is possible to use applesign outside the Apple ecosystem, but this requires

## Self Signed certificates

You can read more about rcodesign and certificates in:

- https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apple_codesign_certificate_management.html#apple-codesign-certificate-management

```sh
$ rcodesign generate-self-signed-certificate --person-name pancake > a.pem
$ rcodesign analyze-certificate --pem-source a.pem
```

With this `a.pem` file you can now sign a binary like this:

```sh
$ rcodesign sign --pem-source a.pem --code-signature-flags runtime /path/to/binary
```
